# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Converted c++ code to python, that was part of my educational program but closely related to my main goal

**Thoughts:** I struggled with IdentationError. Tabs are my best friends from now. This lab work is not finished yet. Will try to finish and test it out tomorrow completely.
